# ScreenSaverGallery
Welcome to the ScreenSaverGallery project! This repository contains the code for a unique screensaver (ScreenSaverGallery), transforming your screen into a gallery of digital and online art. 

## About
ScreenSaverGallery is an innovative project that merges the worlds of digital art and screen savers. Our aim is to breathe new life into the screensaver medium by turning it into a dynamic canvas for contemporary art. The screensaver showcases artworks that either act as screen savers or thematize virtual space, networking, and digital interaction. It is not just a platform for presenting art but also an experimental environment for its development.

Artworks in the ScreenSaverGallery are curated to add a new dimension by placing them in the context of a screensaver. Curators, artists, researchers and developers are invited to explore and experiment with the possibilities offered by this medium.
